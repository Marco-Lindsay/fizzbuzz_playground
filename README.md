The challenge:

Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

Add one file to solve this as stated above with the simplest, most readable code you can manage.

This solution to fizzbuzz was somethin that I did for an earlier class

Have collaborated and discussed fizzbuzz with https://github.com/enilsen16
