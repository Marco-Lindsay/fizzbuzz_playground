## The challenge:

Write a method that takes one number as an argument. For multiples of three return “Fizz”, and for the multiples of five return “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return “FizzBuzz”, and in all other cases return the number.

Add one file to solve this as stated above with the simplest, most readable code you can manage.


This solution to fizzbuzz was somethin that I did for an earlier class

Have collaborated and discussed fizzbuzz with https://github.com/enilsen16

## The Advanced Challenge:

"Our clients request that numbers that are multiples of seven will result in a "Sivv" (so, 105 will print "FizzBuzzSivv").

Actually, they have a list of 30 other numbers they'd like this program to handle in a similar fashion. For example, multiples of 13 should display with "Grrr". They want to be able to change what/how multiples print every week.

Make a second fizzbuzz program that will handle this kind of arbitrary number/string sets."
